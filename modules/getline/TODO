# WIBNI: continuation prompts, colours, completion
#  - M-: to issue commands directly to getline
#  - M-digit digit .. counts so \e5^X^E opens an editor with LAST FIVE LINES OMG

#  - factor command definitions for symmetry, but don't go overboard
#  - attrs
#  - use exceptions for beep, result
#  - inter-line nav without excessive redraw
#  - a manual, with that call graph

#   x continuation prompts
#   x multi-line redraw (just a keymap / action naming thing?)
#  x fix up history
#  x objectify keymap
#  x -options to Getline, move history etc into components
#  x chan independence

#  x basic completion interface
# OPTIMISATION:
