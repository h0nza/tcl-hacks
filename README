A repository of useful and/or interesting hacks in Tcl.

Some of this stuff I use every day, some is highly experimental, some is just
fun.  It should all be pretty readable.

Subdirectories are independent projects:  see individual READMEs for details.

Initial contents include:

    ebnf    - a recursive-descent parser generator with a cute implementation
    go      - a reimplementation of https://github.com/securitykiss-com/csp
    inet    - a toy inetd with inbuilt coroutine-based services
    oometa  - TclOO extension done right
    procmap - collect metadata about Tcl procedures at runtime.  Dangerously.
    tcltags - ctags(1) clone for Tcl

    modules - various general-purpose pure-Tcl modules

    hacks   - interesting hacks that are too experimental to be useful yet
